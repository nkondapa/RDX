Universal Sparse Autoencoders (USAEs) create a universal, interpretable concept space that reveals what multiple vision models learn in common about the visual world.

## Getting Started

See setup instructions for [Overcomplete](https://github.com/KempnerInstitute/overcomplete). Python 3.8 or later is required.

Run **_uni_demo.py_** to set up and train a USAE: ```python -m uni_demo```

## Features

- **USAE training framework**
- **Evaluation Notebook** to validate metrics of trained USAE

To replicate the model used for our paper, see config.yaml file for hyperparameters. The training script assumes activations are in specified form (see uni_demo.py for details). Our dataset/loader is customized for Imagenet and assumes activations have been cached to .npz form.

## Data Pipeline Details
During **training**, each batch is expected to be in the form:
- Model Activations X and labels Y in tuple ( X{Dict: (models s_1...s_k)}, Y)
where each value from model key s_i is in form N(batch size) x d_i(activation dimension)

The **Activation Dataset/Loader** is customized for training on Imagenet:
- requires model activations to be cached
- assumes activation directory follows format of Imagenet directory
- recommended to store all models' activations for each image in one npz file (hence 'combined_npz' param)
- see models.py for model activation details

To **cache model activations from Imagenet**, see scripts in the caching_acts folder.

## Recreating Paper Results 
Download the checkpoints from the following link:
- [ICML USAE Model Checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zkh5Ftd2dRJFKEzYwad0AZKsn-A8MWNx?usp=sharing)
- Place each *.pth file in the checkpoints folder
- Modify config path in example_visualization.py to checkpoints/config.yaml and launch the script
